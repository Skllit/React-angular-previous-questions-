Develop a streamlined loan application form for a bank using ReactJS. The form should require applicants to provide essential details for the loan application and include routing based on the validation of these details.

Fields:

Full Name: Text field
Loan Amount: Number field
Purpose of Loan: Dropdown with options (House, Car, Personal, Education)
Tenure: Number field (in years)

Tasks:

Create a loan application form component with the specified fields.
Verify submission with all valid details filled in.
Ensure the loan amount entered is within specified minimum and maximum limits(1000 and 1000000).
Check that the tenure is within acceptable limits(1-30 years).
Ensure proper error messages are shown for both valid and invalid entries.
If validations pass, navigate to a welcome page using React Router.
If validations fail, navigate to an Error Page using React Router.

You need to complete the following files:

./src/ErrorPage.js
./src/LoanForm.js
./src/WelcomePage.js
// ErrorPage.js

import React from 'react';

const ErrorPage = () => {
    // Error message should be displayed in h1
};

export default ErrorPage;
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import './App.css';
const LoanForm = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const \[formData, setFormData] = useState({
    fullName: "",
    loanAmount: "",
    purpose: "House",
    tenure: "",
  });
  const \[errors, setErrors] = useState({});

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData({ ...formData, \[name]: value });
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const validationErrors = {};
    // Validations rules: if valid than navigate to welcome page otherwies 
    // navigate to error page
    
  };

  return (
    <div>
    <h1 className="header">Bank Loan Form</h1>

    {/\* Create Loan Form HTML \*/}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LoanForm;
// WelcomePage.js

import React from 'react';

const WelcomePage = () => {
    // welcome message should be shown in h1
};

export default WelcomePage;    complete the code
